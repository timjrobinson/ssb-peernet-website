# SSB PeerNet Website

This is the source code for the [SSB PeerNet] website. SSB PeerNet is a collection of [Scuttlebutt] pub servers run by me that anyone can use.

You can find invite codes for the SSB PeerNet servers on the [SSB pub list]

## Future Plans

- Add visualization of load/CPU/memory/connections for each server
- Add visualization of Scuttlebutt usage levels with [ssb-usage-stats]
- Add visualization of all known Scuttlebutt users with [ssb-to-graphml]
- Add ability to generate invites on the fly instead of pre-creating multi-use codes
